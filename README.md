React and React-DOM:

Packages: react, react-dom
Purpose: These are the core libraries for building React applications. react contains the functionality for defining React components, and react-dom is responsible for rendering those components in the DOM.
React Router:

Package: react-router-dom
Purpose: React Router provides navigation and routing capabilities to the React application. It allows you to define different routes and their corresponding components, enabling a single-page application (SPA) experience.
Ant Design:

Package: antd
Purpose: Ant Design is a React UI library that provides a set of high-quality components and styles. In this app, Ant Design is used for building the user interface, including cards, buttons, and input components.
Axios:

Package: axios
Purpose: Axios is a promise-based HTTP client that simplifies making HTTP requests. In the app, Axios is used to fetch data from an external API (news articles).
React-Stripe-Checkout:

Package: react-stripe-checkout
Purpose: This package provides a React component for integrating with Stripe Checkout, a pre-built checkout page hosted by Stripe. It simplifies the process of handling payments in the app.
React-Toastify:

Package: react-toastify
Purpose: React Toastify is a library for displaying toast notifications in React applications. In this app, it is used to show success or failure messages when processing payments or other actions.
Ant Design Styles:

Package: antd/dist/antd.css
Purpose: This is the stylesheet for Ant Design. It contains the default styles for Ant Design components. Importing this file ensures that the styles are applied to the components used in the app.
React Scripts:

Package: react-scripts
Purpose: React Scripts provides scripts and configurations for Create React App. It includes development and build scripts, making it easy to set up and run React applications.







# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
